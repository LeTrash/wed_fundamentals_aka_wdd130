      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this website is to guide students to the avalible
        resources within campus as well as around Rexburg. I noticed while
        talking to friends and peers that not many know about the ametities
        offered on campus. It feels like a waste because these resources are
        free and open to almost every student. There are also several fun
        activies that occur that most students miss on because they're not aware
        and aren't willing to look. I wanted to create a site where it
        categorizes subjects for students to find things. The sections will be
        titled: Study, Activites, Health, and Finacial (Open to modifications).
        These sections will then lead to a list of links that describe their
        purpose and how you can use it for your desired problem. It is intended
        to create a quick and easy naviagtion for the resources avaible because
        the BYU-I website is complicated on it's own and students don't even
        bother.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        My main audience is the students that attend BYU-I and live in Rexburg.
        Those who live outside of Rexburg or don't attend BYU-I are free to
        explore, however, some options may not be applicable to them. Because I
        am targeting 18-24 year olds it will be a simple site with easy to read
        and understand font while having an interesting layout. I want to keep
        the students engaged but not bored and because of the rush of college
        culture I will only touch on the description of links. The categorizes
        will be centered around students here in Rexburg. I will keep the color
        scheme calm and not too bold.

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
      <p>
        Palette URL:

        </tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Archivo Black
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Sans Serif
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
      <p>
        Here at BYU-I it's difficult to find times to relax or hang with your
        friends. Especially if you don't have a car or family to show you
        around. It feels as if nothing happens around Rexburg, it's literally a
        desert! However, if you look carefully you'll find several activites to
        explore.
      </p>
      <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
      <p class="colored">
        Having a hard time finding a comfortable and quiet place to study? Need
        a room for a group project and no ones apartment is clean? BYU-I has
        prepared for that! This link will take you to a reservation site where
        you can book rooms right on campus for you to use for free! It's
