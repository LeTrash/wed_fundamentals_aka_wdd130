      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this website is to guide students to the avalible
        resources within campus as well as around Rexburg. I noticed while
        talking to friends and peers that not many know about the ametities
        offered on campus. It feels like a waste because these resources are
        free and open to almost every student. There are also several fun
        activies that occur that most students miss on because they're not aware
        and aren't willing to look. I wanted to create a site where it
        categorizes subjects for students to find things. The sections will be
        titled: Study, Activites, Health, and Finacial (Open to modifications).
        These sections will then lead to a list of links that describe their
        purpose and how you can use it for your desired problem. It is intended
        to create a quick and easy naviagtion for the resources avaible because
        the BYU-I website is complicated on it's own and students don't even
        bother.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        My main audience is the students that attend BYU-I and live in Rexburg.
        Those who live outside of Rexburg or don't attend BYU-I are free to
        explore, however, some options may not be applicable to them. Because I
        am targeting 18-24 year olds it will be a simple site with easy to read
        and understand font while having an interesting layout. I want to keep
        the students engaged but not bored and because of the rush of college
        culture I will only touch on the description of links. The categorizes
        will be centered around students here in Rexburg. I will keep the color
        scheme calm and not too bold.

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Archivo Black
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Sans Serif
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
      <p>
        Here at BYU-I it's difficult to find times to relax or hang with your
        friends. Especially if you don't have a car or family to show you
        around. It feels as if nothing happens around Rexburg, it's literally a
        desert! However, if you look carefully you'll find several activites to
        explore.
      </p>
      <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
      <p class="colored">
        Having a hard time finding a comfortable and quiet place to study? Need
        a room for a group project and no ones apartment is clean? BYU-I has
        prepared for that! This link will take you to a reservation site where

      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The idea of this site is to provide easy navigation that directs
        students of BYU-I the resources avaible to them. There are several
        assets that aid in student success that campus as well as the church
        invest in. I hope that visitors will approach the site with questions
        about campus resouces, regardless if they are specificlly looking for
        fianical or academic queries. The home page will produce a simple
        instruction that informs the user of the websites purpose and encourage
        them to explore. Below the header will be the themes with a
        corresponding picture a link connected with both the button and image.
        There will also be a random button than links the user to a random site
        that is within the pages. At the bottom there is a description of how to
        search BYU-I's own website for additional information. As well as info
        on the self made cougar logo. Lastly there will be a picture and quote
        from the prophets prophecy about this college as well as links to
        lds.org and the talk. I may impliment a spiritual page as well. There
        will also be a tips page that just gives little points on how to get
        through college life.

      <h3>Academics</h3>
      <p>
        BYU-I is a university, meaning that it deals with several departments of
        study. There are at least 6 colleges, each with their own layers of
        departments and offices. It can get confusing when you just want to work
        on your classes and obtain a comforatble income. However it doesn't have
        to be too complicated. There are several means to creating a simple and
        relaxed enviroment for your education journey. BYU-I tries its best to
        make it easy to understand and get by. They also have resources to aid
        with outside life that may affect academics.

      <h3>Events</h3>
      <p>
        Rexburg is a desert. Literally, it's surrounded by plains and mountain.
        The worst thing in college is being bored when you don't have to be.
        Sure you may have great activies at home such as your switch or netflix
        but theres wonderful activies outside of your apartment. There are great
        clubs and events that campus constantly supports as well as Rexburgs own
        community and enviroment that provide ideas. Whether it be connecting
        with your friends, going on a date, or entertaing yourself there are
        great place around town. You only have to make the effort to look.

      <h3>Financial</h3>
      <p>
        It's nothing to be ashamed of. Having trouble with funds and income is
        something that everyone deals with. The worst thing to do is to stay in
        your current situation if there is a better option. BYU-I does it's best
        to keep tution as low as possible so you don't have to suffer through
        your studies. But there is more to this college than just low tuition,
        especially for those of specific situations. Life happens and it sucks,
        definatly in this capitalistic economy. Take advantage of the resources
        provided. There is no shame. Heck the employees beg for students to use
        them! It's their job and if you don't use it at all then their efforts
        go to waste.

      <h3>Health</h3>
      <p>
        The one thing that every college student disregards is personal health.
        It's a hard problem to deal with, especially when you're the only one
        checking in on yourself. However, campus cares about you and knows how
        important taking care of you body is. BYU-I provides several resources
        that make self-care eaiser to impliment in your daily life. The only
        thing you have left to do is commit.

      <h3>Tips</h3>
      <p>
        College is different for everyone. Some people love to slack off on work
        and party around while others dig themselves in their assignments to the
        point of depression. No one is perfect and college is tough. However,
        these are some tips that aided my journey.
      </p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          Check out the BYU-I instagram stories and posts, they usually provide
          vital information for uncomming events or due dates.
        </li>
        <li>
          The second floor of the McKay Library is a great place to study and
          consentrate on homework. It's an offical quiet area with several seats
          and outlets to choose from.
        </li>
        <li>
          TALK TO YOUR PROFESSORS. They're human and most likely will understand
          what ever problem or situation has come up. If they don't, get a
          better teacher.
        </li>
        <li>
          When choosing classes, use ratemyprofessor.com. I swear it will save
          your college experience. I've been able to have wonderful teachers
          that work with my learning style due to that site. It has it's quirks
          but so far it hasn't failed me.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pick a schedule that works for you. If you focus in the morning, take
          early classes. If you function in the evening or night, take evening
          classes and sleep in. BYU-I gives you the option to format your
          schedule according to your style. Don't push yourself just because you
          feel you need to adhere to your past high school habits. Sometimes
          getting an hour of sleep will set you up for a more productive day.
        </li>
