        <h1>Tips</h1>
        <p>
          College is different for everyone. Some people love to slack off on
          work and party around while others dig themselves in their assignments
          to the point of depression. No one is perfect and college is tough.
          However, these are some tips that aided my journey.
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            Check out the BYU-I instagram stories and posts, they usually
            provide vital information for uncomming events or due dates.
          </li>
          <li>
            The second floor of the McKay Library is a great place to study and
            consentrate on homework. It's an offical quiet area with several
            seats and outlets to choose from.
          </li>
          <li>
            TALK TO YOUR PROFESSORS. They're human and most likely will
            understand what ever problem or situation has come up. If they
            don't, get a better teacher.
          </li>
          <li>
            When choosing classes, use ratemyprofessor.com. I swear it will save
            your college experience. I've been able to have wonderful teachers
            that work with my learning style due to that site. It has it's
            quirks but so far it hasn't failed me.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pick a schedule that works for you. If you focus in the morning,
            take early classes. If you function in the evening or night, take
            evening classes and sleep in. BYU-I gives you the option to format
            your schedule according to your style. Don't push yourself just
            because you feel you need to adhere to your past high school habits.
            Sometimes getting an hour of sleep will set you up for a more
            productive day.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't forget to have fun! Yes, your grades are important but so are
            you. So make sure to take some time to relax and hang out with
            friends.

          If none of these categorizes are what you're looking for then I
          suggest trying out the search bar on BYU-I's own website. I've used it
          a lot myself and it'll help you find several links!
