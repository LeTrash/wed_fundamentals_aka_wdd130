              One of the first places to check for fun is the I-belong site.
              They even have their own app that notifies you of upcoming events
              along with a calendar. There are several activities to choose from
              right on campus!

            <p>
              Love to get outside and enjoy the outdoors? ORC is just the place!
              They rent crazy cheap prices to anyone and recommend several great
              areas of recreation. They work just beneath the football seats!

              Want to show off some classic country dance moves but BYU-I is
              full and only throws down on Wednesday? Come on down to the
              Tavern! They host country dancing nights almost each day for only
              $3 a person! They have some crazy dance moves that often aren't
              allowed on BYU-I grounds.

            <p>
              The St. Anthony Sand Dunes are a common hot spot for people to
              come together at night and host a bond fire. Gather some friends
              around to roast smores or dirt bike if you have one. When it snows
              it's a great spot to go sledding!

          If none of these categorizes are what you're looking for then I
          suggest trying out the search bar on BYU-I's own website. I've used it
          a lot myself and it'll help you find several links!
