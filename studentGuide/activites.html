            One of the first places to check for fun is the I-belong site. They
            even have their own app that notifies you of upcoming events along
            with a calendar. There are several activities to choose from right
            on campus!

            Love to get outside and enjoy the outdoors? ORC is just the place!
            They rent crazy cheap prices to anyone and recommend several great
            areas of recreation. They work just beneath the football seats!

            Want to show off some classic country dance moves but BYU-I is full
            and only throws down on Wednesday? Come on down to the Tavern! They
            host country dancing nights almost each day for only $3 a person!
            They have some crazy dance moves that often aren't allowed on BYU-I
            grounds.

          <p>
            The St. Anthony Sand Dunes are a common hot spot for people to come
            together at night and host a bond fire. Gather some friends around
            to roast smores or dirt bike if you have one. When it snows it's a
            great spot to go sledding!

            If none of these categorizes are what you're looking for then I
            suggest trying out the search bar on BYU-I's own website. I've used
            it a lot myself and it'll help you find several links!
