            The campus library is a huge resource avaiable to all students and
            friends. There are circulation desks on each floor to clear up
            confusion and check out books as well as printers that only charge
            $0.04/page Black & White or $0.25/page for colored. There are
            libirarins that specicilize in each department and are happy to help
            with research papers, sources, and access to materials. The Mab Lab
            on the first floor provides free access to adobe creative cloud,
            equipment for checkout, and 3D printing for only $0.10 a gram! On
            the 2nd floor there is also the Grandin Press which is a fully
            funcitonal repilic of the printing press that printed the Book of
            Mormon along side the Special COllections room that allow students
            access to primary resouce documents and prehistoric artificats. The
            second floor is also a quite area making it a wonderful place to
