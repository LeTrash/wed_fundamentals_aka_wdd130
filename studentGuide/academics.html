              When you need a quiet study room for yourself or a group you can
              easily reserve a free one on campus. Just sign in with your school
              account and type in the details of your session such as date,
              time, and specifc area. Be sure to book at least 2 days in advance
              to get your room! Although you may get lucky if you book only a
              few hours before.

              The campus library is a huge resource avaiable to all students and
              friends. There are circulation desks on each floor to clear up
              confusion and check out books. There are libirarins that
              specicilize in each department and are happy to help with research
              papers, sources, and access to materials. The Mab Lab on the first
              floor provides free access to adobe creative cloud, equipment for
              checkout, and 3D printing for only $0.10 a gram! On the 2nd floor
              there is also the Grandin Press which is a fully funcitonal
              repilic of the printing press that printed the Book of Mormon
              along side the Special COllections room that allow students access
              to primary resouce documents and prehistoric artificats. The
              second floor is also a quite area making it a wonderful place to
              study or complete assignments without disruption.

          If none of these categorizes are what you're looking for then I
          suggest trying out the search bar on BYU-I's own website. I've used it
          a lot myself and it'll help you find several links!
