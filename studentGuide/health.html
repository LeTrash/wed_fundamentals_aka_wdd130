            If you're reading this then I'm proud of you and you should be as
            well. It's hard to keep youself in check, espieclly when you're
            handed control over your life that you didn't have before. It's not
            easy to accept help, it took me at least 6 years to finally talk to
            others. But it's worth it. This life is hard and you're not expected
            to do it alone. So I'm proud that you've made it this far and are
            taking the time to try, taking the time to see what you can do.
