              information, and step-by-step tutortials. They have specific

              think your question is too detailed or weird to ask you can submit

              Don't have parent insurance to fall back on? Don't want to pay for
              the Universities own insurance? Apply for medicaid! The Idaho
              Department of Health & Welfare is the Division of Medicaid and
              they are open to students! It's easy to apply, either submit your
              information online or go in person! You may be denyed but you
              never know unless you try. I was able to get approved within
              minutes and I thought I wouldn't have a chance.

          If none of these categorizes are what you're looking for then I
          suggest trying out the search bar on BYU-I's own website. I've used it
          a lot myself and it'll help you find several links!
