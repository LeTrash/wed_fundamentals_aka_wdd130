            Don't have parent insurance to fall back on? Don't want to pay for
            the Universities own insurance? Apply for medicaid! The Idaho
            Department of Health & Welfare is the Division of Medicaid and they
            are open to students! It's easy to apply, either submit your
            information online or go in person! You may be denyed but you never
            know unless you try. I was able to get approved within minutes and I
