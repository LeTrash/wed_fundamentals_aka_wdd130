          Welcome to the BYU-I Student Guide! This is not an offical BYU-I
          website, rather it is an independant project from a helpful
          programmer. I've noticed that several students don't realize the
          amount of resources this universtiy provides. This site organizes
          those resources into a simple category system and presents a quick
          summary on the topic. I have expereince with a few of these links and
          they've been able to make my semesters 10 times better than I
          expected. I hope that you will be able to improve your life as I have
          been able to.

          The topics below are clickable and will lead you to a page that
          expands on their category. Each item will have a little description
          and if you click on their title then it will send you do their site.

            If none of these categorizes are what you're looking for then I
            suggest trying out the search bar on BYU-I's own website. I've used
            it a lot myself and it'll help you find several links!

            <h2>A Steady Upward Course</h2>
            <p>
              "I’ll make you a prophesy. I will simply tell you: The day will
              come that that capacity to influence people around you for good
              will have you singled out as one of the great leaders in whatever
              place you’re in. They will not quite know why, but you will know
              that the reason you are being singled out is not because of your
              innate gifts as a leader but because you have done what the Savior
              would do—learned how to, and did, reach out to those around you to
              try to lift them, to help them to be better even when it might be
              a little bit difficult and you might not have been received very
              well...I testify to you this beautiful campus that you see now is
              the reward from a loving God and His Board of Education that said:
              “We know those people. We know what they’re like. They’re out of a
              pioneer heritage, and they don’t think that the things they have
              mean much. It’s what they are. And they think they can do a very
              great deal without very much.”"
            </p>
